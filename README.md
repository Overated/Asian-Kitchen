# Asian-Kitchen

## This repo is [Patica.dev](https://www.patika.dev/tr) a homework repo that I created to reinforce the knowledge we learned in the JavaScript course, which is designed as a far eastern restaurant menu, developed with Javascript and allows you to switch between pages. It contains README, Css, Html and Js files.
